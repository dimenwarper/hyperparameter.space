My full name is `Sergio Pablo Sanchez Cordero Gonzalez` but I usually go (and publish) by Pablo Cordero. I'm currently a data scientist at Stripe. Previously I've been a computational biologist at [Hexagon Bio](http://www.hexagonbio.com/), mining the world's fungalome for drugs, a postdoc at UCSC's [systems biology group](https://sysbiowiki.soe.ucsc.edu/) doing applied machine learning research on single-cell measurements, and I did my doctoral work in RNA structure, the genomics of cardiovascular disease, and other things with Rhiju Das and Euan Ashley at Stanford University. I also do consulting from time to time. I tinker with NLP models as a hobby. Check out the links to my github, scholar, mail, etc. down below if you're interested in that stuff or in contacting me.
