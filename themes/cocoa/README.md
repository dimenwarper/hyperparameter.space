## Quick start 

From the root of your Hugo site, clone the theme into `themes/cocoa` by running:

```sh
# Clone theme into the themes/cocoa directory
$ git clone https://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme.git themes/cocoa

# Generate site files into the public directory
$ hugo -t cocoa

# Or, serve your site and visit localhost:1313 in your browser
$ hugo -t cocoa --watch serve
```

## Usage

#### config.toml

Please see the sample [`config.toml`](https://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml). Note that if you already use cocoa but have updated to Hugo 0.18, you must lowercase every params of your existing `config.toml` (like in the sample).

#### Creating posts

Posts should generally go under a `content/blog` directory. Typically you would run:

````
hugo new blog/your-new-post.md
````
For posts to appear on your site, you may need `draft = false` in the post's front matter or use the `--buildDrafts` option when building.

#### Creating fixed pages

Fixed pages such as an About page should preferably go under `content/fixed` or be present at the root of the `content` directory.

````
hugo new fixed/about.md
````
