I recently read an interesting entry in the nnil? blog trying to frame our understanding of biology by asking several key questions. The questions were derived from Tinberg's four questions, which mostly focus on animal behavior. While I've dabbled in biology for some time, I've mostly been focused studying molecular mechanisms. My world is that of genes, enzymes, nucleic acids, and maybe cells. What are the questions we ask then when we want to test our understanding of molecular machines and how they relate to higher order phenotypes? When searching the literature for hints of these questions, I was reminded of a set of ten precepts that the legendary Arthur Kornberg published in his article "Ten Commandments: Lessons from the Enzymology of DNA Replication". Kornberg's ten commandments are a mix of recommendations of empirical frameworks that have been successful time and time again as well as warnings of the limits of intuition and rationalization when dealing with entities (like enzymes) that we can only interrogate and probe under limited contexts. Crucially, they are the distilled thoughts that guided t
