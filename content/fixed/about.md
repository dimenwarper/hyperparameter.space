My full name is `Sergio Pablo Sanchez Cordero Gonzalez` but I usually go (and publish) by Pablo Cordero. I'm currently a postdoc at UCSC's [systems biology group](https://sysbiowiki.soe.ucsc.edu/) doing applied machine learning research in the context of cell biology and regenerative medicine, particularly looking at single-cell measurements. I also do consulting from time to time. My hobbies are natural language processing and deep learning. Check out the links to my github, scholar, mail, etc. down below if you're interested in that stuff or in contacting me.
