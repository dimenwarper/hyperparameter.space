# The randomized algorithm mindset: how can we embed machine learning seamlessly into algorithmic design?

Perhaps at the core of computer science lies the concept of algorithm: that set of instructions to be run on a Turing machine. Algorithms are solutions to all sorts of problems, from sorting numbers to efficiently selling stuff in a circuit of cities, but their general nature has not percluded their efficient classifications. When we think on algorithm classes we typically think in terms of worst case analysis, that is, given the size of the input, how many calculations does the algorithm take to finish and give us an answer in the worst possible case. This mindset pushes the algorithmic designer to generate recipes that are truly efficient no matter the input -- it is satisfying to know that sorting n numbers will always take no more than an order of nlog(n) operations. This way of thinking permeates not only algorithmic design but extends to classifying the problems these algorithms solve and gives rise to the famous P/NP classification. Unfortunately, this also puts a bit of a theoretical barrier when dealing with problems that worst-case analysis deems the hardest. Since we don't know, and it's extremely unlikely that, NP-hard problems can be solved efficiently, whenever we confront one of these problems (and boy are they everywhere) we know that we will have to compromise somehow. 

The quest for solving these difficult problems (often combinatorial in nature) have yielded (or improved) rich and very general optimization techinques such as simulated annealing, cross entropy, tabu search, genetic algorithms, and yes even deep reinforcement learning. The main idea goes like this: since many of these NP-hard problems deal with an exploding space of possibilities depending on their input size, then somehow search that space efficiently for the best solution you can find. If you're tackling the travelling salesman problem How efficiently the space is searched will depend on the nature (and sometimes instance!) of the problem
