# Machine learning is geometry; geometry is everything

There's a famous high-school/college chemistry textbook that goes by the title of "Chemistry, the central science". It's a hefty tome and I likely don't recall even 1% of its content, but the statement in the title made an impression: if one would want to make such a bold claim -- that a field is central many others -- what arguments would be needed to back it up? One approach would be to go big and argue that the sheer size and usefulness of the knowledge of one field touches many aspects of others. I do believe that chemistry is central by this definition (after all, a giant library of chemical reactions governs your everyday life). Another approach would be to go small, noting that lots of seemingly unrelated concepts can be obtained or explained from scratch from the central field's small set of principles. Geometry stands firmly in this space.
